# Intel AI Software on AWS SageMaker Marketplace

This repo contain example notebooks with instructions on using Intel AI Software listed in AWS SageMaker Marketplace.

Intel and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing services, have worked [together for over a decade](https://aws.amazon.com/intel/) to ensure AWS services run on a platform optimized for customer workloads at the best value. At the annual [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) conference from November 26-30, AWS is highlighting advancements in this ongoing collaboration, including the new [AWS Marketplace for Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/mp/ai/), developed by AWS for its Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platform, [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).
